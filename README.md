I started this Desktop file explorer to assist my father's business in quickly organizing files and docments of different types.

I spent immense amounts of time figuring out the tkinter library and building a functioning GUI, and the future idea was to allow for bulk actions, etc that are very specific to my father's business.

However, I no longer intend to continue working on the project.
